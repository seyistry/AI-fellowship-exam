'''
Question 1

Write a Python program that works as a basic calculator with continuous use.

Instruction
    The program should repeatedly allow the user to perform operations until they choose to exit.
    Ask the user to enter two numbers.
    Then ask them to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
    Use functions to define each operation.
    Use try-except to handle invalid input and division by zero.
    Use control flow (if-elif-else) to select the correct operation.
    Use a while loop to keep running until the user chooses to exit.

"""Question 2

    Complete the missing parts of the program below so that it keeps asking the user for a number and tells whether it is even or odd.

Instruction

    Use input, int conversion, if-else control flow, and print output.
    Use a while loop that runs until the user types 'exit'.

"""Question 3
    The following code is supposed to ask for a userâ€™s age repeatedly and say whether they are allowed to vote (18+).
    It should also exit if the user types 'exit'. However, the code contains errors.
