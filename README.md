### Exam 1

#### 1. Basic Calculator
A Python program that acts as a simple calculator, allowing continuous operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) until the user chooses to exit. It uses functions for each operation, handles invalid input and division by zero, and employs a while loop for repeated use.

#### 2. Even or Odd Checker
A loop-based program that repeatedly asks the user for a number and determines if it is even or odd. The program continues until the user types 'exit', with input validation for non-numeric entries.

#### 3. Voting Eligibility
A program that repeatedly prompts the user for their age and informs them if they are eligible to vote (18+). The loop exits when the user types 'exit', and invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
