# AI Fellowship Exam â€“ Solutions by Oluwaseyi Egunjobi

This repository contains solutions to the AI Fellowship Exam programming tasks, implemented in `oluwaseyi_egunjobi_exam.py`.

## Contents

### Exam 1

#### 1. Basic Calculator
A Python program that acts as a simple calculator, allowing continuous operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) until the user chooses to exit. It uses functions for each operation, handles invalid input and division by zero, and employs a while loop for repeated use.

#### 2. Even or Odd Checker
A loop-based program that repeatedly asks the user for a number and determines if it is even or odd. The program continues until the user types 'exit', with input validation for non-numeric entries.

#### 3. Voting Eligibility
A program that repeatedly prompts the user for their age and informs them if they are eligible to vote (18+). The loop exits when the user types 'exit', and invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

### Exam 2

#### Question1 - Pandas for Data Analysis
You are required to perform the following data wrangling tasks using Pandas and NumPy.

#### Question2 - Numpy for numeric computation
You are required to perform the following data analysis and manipulation tasks using NumPy.

#### Question3 - Statistics for statistical analysis
You are required to use the Markdown section of your Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to compute and present your solutions for all questions.

#### Question4 - Linear Algebra
Background: We are analyzing the performance of 4 students in 3 subjects: Mathematics, English, and Science. The data is represented by the matrix $A$: $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 80 & 70 & 90 \ 60 & 85 & 75 \ 95 & 88 & 92 \ 70 & 60 & 65 \end{bmatrix}$$ Each row represents a student, and each column represents a subject (Math, English, Science).
